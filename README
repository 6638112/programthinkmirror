to update forum section only:

cd <hosting directory of programthinkmirror>
cd forum4
./year.sh
wc -l olddd
wc -l newww
make sure the two match
 if not, then programthink has added a new blog article
 in this case please refer to section below
./master0.sh
./master6.sh
rm *.html
./master4.sh


when programthink has added a new blog article:
(note: sometimes programthink lags in updating the
BTSync off-line blog folder, in this case one
can update the forum section first, then update
the blog when the updated off-line blog folder
becomes available later. That is, updating the nlist
without updating the mlist, and carry out all the
steps associated with updating the nlist/forum without
carrying out the final steps associated with updating
the mlist and the overall blog, e.g. master7.sh, etc.)

update src/mlist/mlist
update src/nlist/nlist
cp src/mlist/mlist .
cp src/nlist/nlist forum4/
cd forum4
mv ../src/pt17/shift.sh forum4/
edit seq <bign> ... to seq <bign+1> ...
uncomment seq line
./shift.sh (RUN ONLY ONCE!!!)
recomment seq line
mv shift.sh ../src/pt17/
./year.sh
vim olddd
add "0\n" line to the beginning of olddd
wc -l olddd
wc -l newww
make sure both match
./master0.sh
./master6.sh
rm *.html
./master4.sh
delete everything from <hosting directory of programthinkmirror> EXCEPT src/ forum4/ and the files in ./
use midnight commander to copy everything from updated "blog" folder of BT Sync to <hosting directory of programthinkmirror>
./master7.sh
sed -i -e 's/http:/https:/g' index.html
(other manual cosmetic changes are applied to index.html at your discretion, please refer to index.html in this repository)


an additional note on src/:

the src/ contains both production and historical/deprecated codes,
folders containing production codes are:
pt10/
pt17/
pt18/


an additional note on >1000 forums:

comments >500 are all appended into section C
pt17/sensor.sh reveals difference between last checkpoint
when difference exceed 500,
(use the lab/ directory for the following)
append section C to current section B
and make resulting file the new section C
vim section C
go to second line
